Distribution for GULP 5.1 :
===========================

The following is a guide to the directories that should be present in this distribution :

Docs        : documentation and information relating to the program
Examples    : example input files for the program
Libraries   : library files for the program
Src         : source code and files relating to the installation of the program
Utils       : utility routines associated with GULP

To install GULP on most Unix/Linux machines :

(1) Go to Src/
(2) Type "./mkgulp"
    NB: There are several flags that can be added depending on what options are
        required. The main options are:
        -h => print help text to list the options below
        -m => parallel compilation with MPI
        -d => compile with debug options
        -f => compile with FFTW3 for Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald
        -k => compile with OpenKIM
        -p => compile with Plumed plug-in
        -c ARG => change the compiler to "ARG". gfortran (default) and intel are supported.
        -j ARG => specify the number of cores to be used for task (i.e. make -j)

        -t ARG => change the task to ARG. gulp (default), clean, lib, tar, fox-clean
(3) If the above fails - edit "mkgulp" and correct the settings for your machine
    NB: Look for the string "USER" for places where you may need to edit things that
        are specific to your machine. Usually the libraries are in a different location
        or not installed if compilation fails.
(4) Set the following environment variables to indicate where the program files can
    be found:

    GULP_LIB    The location of the Libraries directory
    GULP_DOC    The location of the Doc directory
    ALAMODE_DIR The main directory for the alamode code for thermal conductivity calculations
